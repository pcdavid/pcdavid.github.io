## about me

My name is Pierre-Charles David. I'm a software engineer at [Obeo](http://www.obeo.fr/), where I work mainly on [Eclipse Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius), both the Eclipse-based desktop version and the new [Sirius Web](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web) implementation of the same principle using modern web technologies.

I also maintain [GMF Runtime](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.gmf-runtime), [EMF Services](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.emfservices), and [Ecore Tools](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.ecoretools/), and contribute to a few other Eclipse projects related to Sirius.
