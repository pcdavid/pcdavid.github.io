## about me

My name is Pierre-Charles David.
I'm a software engineer at [Obeo](https://www.obeo.fr/), where I work mainly on [Eclipse Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius).

both the Eclipse-based desktop version and the new [Sirius Web](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web) implementation of the same principle using modern web technologies.

I also maintain several other Eclipse projets related to Sirius:
- [EMF Services](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.emfservices): regroups [EMF Validation](https://github.com/eclipse/emf-validation) and [EMF Transaction](https://github.com/eclipse/emf-transaction).
- [GMF Runtime](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.gmf-runtime): regroups [GMF Notation](https://github.com/eclipse/gmf-notation) and [GMF Runtime](https://github.com/eclipse/gmf-notation) itself.
- [Ecore Tools](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.ecoretools/): a complete graphical environment to create, edit and maintain Ecore models. Built with Eclipse Sirius.
